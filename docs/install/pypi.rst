PyPi
====

-  https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/twitterwall

You can use pip (and the Test PyPi) to install package **twitterwall**:

::

    pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi twitterwall

-  *NOTE*: You can not use only the ``-i``, because some of the required
   packages are not in the Test PyPi.

Again you can run this command system-wide (watch you Python version) or
setup virtual environment first as described in :doc:`requirements`.
